# About Me
## My Intrest 
  - My intrest include listnening to muisc and kickboxing. I'm interrsted  in music becuase it does a better job at geeting my thoughts across to other people than i do sometimes. When I was younger I always wanted to do martial arts so, I would like the free time to pursue that more seriously as an adult.
## Websites I Recommend
  - Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/) 
    Youtube has a variety of different topics you can look into. I like to look at motivational speaches, music, comedy videos.
    
  - Google (https://www.google.com/) 
    Google is my preferred search engine. It can point you in the right direction of whatever you're looking for. Also, I have been using it most of my life.
